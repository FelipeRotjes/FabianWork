                    <p class="text-bio-3">
                        As a very recent videographer, Fabián’s work is based on independent
                        collaborations with stylists, make-up artists, designers, musicians and
                        performers by creating short and long format video pieces as director of
                        photography and editor. Since 2020, he has been developing the project PLICA, a
                        Miami-based art project in collaboration with artist Mikhael Scarr that
                        addresses topics as politics in the post-truth era, the artist's role and
                        identity in society. The project focuses on creating original drawings, books,
                        designs and installations.
